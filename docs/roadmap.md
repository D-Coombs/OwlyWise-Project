# üí∏ Full-Stack Personal Budgeting App - Development Roadmap

This document outlines the phases, features, tools, and deployment strategy for building a multi-platform Personal Budgeting App using:

- Python (Flask) ‚Äî Backend API
- Electron ‚Äî Desktop App
- React / HTML ‚Äî Web Frontend
- React Native ‚Äî Mobile App
- PostgreSQL ‚Äî Centralized Database

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: MVP Desktop App (Electron + Flask Local)

### Goals
- Local-first version with Electron UI and Flask backend
- Store transactions and budgets in SQLite
- Core CRUD functionality

### Tasks
- [ ] Set up Flask project structure
- [ ] Create models: User, Transaction, Budget
- [ ] Build RESTful API endpoints for auth, transactions, budgets
- [ ] Build Electron frontend with HTML/CSS/JS
- [ ] Implement login/signup UI and logic
- [ ] Connect Electron to local Flask API
- [ ] Add basic dashboard UI and table for transactions
- [ ] Save data to local SQLite

---

## üåê Phase 2: Host API + Use Cloud Database

### Goals
- Deploy Flask backend to the web
- Use a cloud-hosted PostgreSQL database

### Tasks
- [ ] Move from SQLite ‚Üí PostgreSQL (SQLAlchemy config)
- [ ] Set up CORS for cross-platform access
- [ ] Add JWT-based authentication to API
- [ ] Deploy backend to Render/Fly.io/Railway
- [ ] Secure with HTTPS and environment variables
- [ ] Update Electron app to connect to hosted API

---

## üåç Phase 3: Build Web App (React or Flask HTML)

### Goals
- Provide browser access to the same features
- Web UI mirrors Electron functionality

### Tasks
- [ ] Set up React app (Vite or CRA) OR use Flask templates
- [ ] Implement login/register UI
- [ ] Connect to API for auth and CRUD
- [ ] Build responsive dashboard with:
  - [ ] Add/edit/delete transaction form
  - [ ] Budget tracker
  - [ ] Charts using Chart.js or Recharts
- [ ] Deploy frontend to Netlify or Vercel

---

## üì± Phase 4: Mobile App with React Native

### Goals
- Mobile version with key features and synced backend

### Tasks
- [ ] Set up React Native project (Expo recommended)
- [ ] Build login/register screens
- [ ] Build transaction entry and history screens
- [ ] Add dashboard view with summary + charts
- [ ] Connect to Flask API using Axios
- [ ] Use AsyncStorage for local caching
- [ ] Test on Android/iOS
- [ ] Deploy via Expo Go or EAS Build

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Phase 5: Enhancements

### Features
- [ ] Monthly financial reports (PDF/CSV export)
- [ ] Recurring transactions
- [ ] Notifications/reminders
- [ ] Multi-currency support
- [ ] Offline mode (local storage + sync)
- [ ] Theme switcher (dark/light mode)
- [ ] Encryption for sensitive financial data

---

## üß† Phase 6: ML-Powered Smart Features

### Goals
- Use machine learning to provide intelligent budgeting insights and automation

### Features
- [ ] **Auto-categorize transactions** using NLP (e.g., Naive Bayes, fine-tuned BERT)
- [ ] **Recommend personalized monthly budgets** based on historical data
- [ ] **Spending prediction & forecasting** (e.g., with Facebook Prophet or LSTM)
- [ ] **Detect anomalies** in spending behavior (e.g., Isolation Forest)
- [ ] **Fraud/spike alerts** for unusual activity
- [ ] **Financial health score** based on spending/saving consistency
- [ ] **Savings goal suggestions** using regression & clustering

### Tools & Libraries
- `scikit-learn`, `spaCy`, `transformers`, `Prophet`, `TensorFlow`, `PyTorch`
- Jupyter Notebooks for prototyping models
- Model deployment via Flask endpoint (`/predict`, `/classify`, etc.)

### Tasks
- [ ] Simulate or collect labeled transaction data
- [ ] Train and validate ML models locally
- [ ] Export models (`.pkl` or `.pt`)
- [ ] Load and integrate models into Flask backend
- [ ] Add ML-powered endpoints for frontend/mobile consumption

---

## üß™ Testing & QA

### Tasks
- [ ] Unit tests for API endpoints (pytest + Flask)
- [ ] UI tests (Playwright, Jest, or Detox for mobile)
- [ ] Manual QA across platforms
